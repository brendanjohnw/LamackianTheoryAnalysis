# Lamarckian Theory Analysis Project
This project compares studies of Mcdougall and Agar et al. on the Lamarckian Theory.

The Lamarckian Theory postulates that successive generations of a particular specie will inherit features, behaviours and habits learnt by their ancestors

The aim of these studies were to see how well the rats learned to escape from a tank of water via the correct exit. There were 2 exits presented, the correct exit was the dimly lit exit while the incorrect exit was brightly lit and induced an electric shock to the rat if entered.
The idea is that light phobia is induced in the rat which would instinctively make them gravitate towards the dimly lit exit.
Successful learning would be confirmed once 12 successive correct choices was made.
Both McDougall and Agar et al. conducted their studies along the identical principle.

McDougall however, did not seperate the samples into control and test groups which were a criticism of Agar et al; driving Agar et al. to conduct a similar trial with
control and test groups.

Hence, the aim was to see whether there were any significant disparities between the two studies.
